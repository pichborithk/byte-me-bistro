#### Backend

- Java: The primary programming language used for developing the backend API, offering a strong and reliable foundation for enterprise-level applications.
- Spring Boot: A Java-based framework that simplifies the development of RESTful APIs with built-in tools for dependency injection, data persistence, and web services.

- Spring Security: A powerful framework within Spring for securing the application, managing authentication, and enforcing role-based access control.
- JWT Authentication: A method for implementing stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens, ensuring secure communication between the client and server.

#### Database

- PostgreSQL: A robust, open-source relational database system that stores and manages all application data, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

#### DevOps

- Docker: A containerization platform that packages the frontend, backend, and database into consistent, isolated environments for development and deployment.
